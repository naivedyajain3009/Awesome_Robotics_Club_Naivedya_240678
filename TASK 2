I chose the Hexapod project because it teaches important robotics skills like mechanical design, inverse kinematics, and gait control. I found it exciting to design a six-legged robot and learn how each leg moves using servo motors. I was also interested in trying different walking styles like tripod and ripple gaits. This project helps me understand how robots walk on rough surfaces and how to control them using Arduino and RC communication.
