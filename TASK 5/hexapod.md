In this question basically we have found out that the coxa arm rotates about the z-axis in the x-y plane and the femur, and the tibia arm rotate in the whole space so now first off as the rotation only occurs in the x-y plane we can find out the angle using tan inverse of y/x and this gives the angle from the x-axis. Now we have found the angle beta and gamma which need to be calculated we can directly apply the cosine law of triangle between femur and tibia to find out the angle between them and convert it into degree angle. Gamma is this value when subtracted from 180-degree angle. To find the value of beta we have used first we find out the value angle between the femur and the direct line from the point till which coxa points to the final target point then we find the angle due to the z elevation separately using the elevation and horizontal distance and we add to get the total angle. But we need to also check for the reachability of the point which is only possible if it is equal to sum or difference of lengths or forms a triangle with it. Finally, we use another function to print the results.
